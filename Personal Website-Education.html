<h1>Educational Background</h1>

<p style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Comic Sans MS, Cursive, sans-serif;">
Growing up in a small town, I did not have many options when it came to education.<br>
I attended <a href=http://mhs.middletownusd.org/ target="_blank"> Middletown High School</a> in Middletown, California. There I participated <br>
in many clubs including yearbook and choir and played football and baseball.<br>
I graduated with high honors and was able to choose between a few different colleges<br>
that I was accepted to. I ended up choosing California State University, Monterey Bay as <br>
it seemed to have an up and comming business program, as well as a beautiful sorrounding area.</p>

<button class="accordion"> <b>Collegiate Education</b></button>
 <div class="panel">
 <p style="font-size: 14px; font-family: Comic Sans MS, Cursive, sans-serif;"> I began attending California State Unversity, Monterey Bay in the Fall of 2013. 
 Though I did not know exactly what I wanted to do with my career at that point, I enrolled into the <a href="https://csumb.edu/business" target="_blank"> College of Business</a>.
 During my first few semesters I became interested in Economics and Finance, however, there was not a major or concentration
 for either of those fields. Trying to relate closely to my interest in Economics and Finance, I decided to declare my concentration in Accounting. 
 After a couple semesters of course work I had decided that this was not the path that I wanted to continue on for the rest of my career and switched my concentration to Marketing.
 <br><br>
 During my time as a student in the College of Business, I gained in various of the business world including accounting, finance, economics, management, international business,
 entrepreneurship and, of course, marketing. I also had the opportunity to take a few classes outside of the core classes of the business program which included an eccommerce website design class,
 a hiking class, and a kayaking class.
